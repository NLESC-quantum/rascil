dprepb_rsexecute_pipeline
=========================

This executes a DPREPB pipeline: deconvolution of calibrated spectral line data. The pipeline uses Dask to
distribute the processing. The Dask graph is constructed with the rsexecute.execute calls
and then the actual calculation is performed by the call rsexecute.compute.


For example, to run on 10 Dask workers on this node::

   python dprepb_rsexecute_pipeline.py --npixel 512

.. code:: ipython3
