# Functions that perform fourier transform processing, both Image->Visibility (predict) and Visibility->Image (
# invert). In  addition there are functions for predicting visibilities from Skycomponents.
#
# For example::
#
#     model = create_image_from_visibility(vt, cellsize=0.001, npixel=256)
#     dirty, sumwt = invert_2d(vt, model)
#     psf, sumwt = invert_2d(vt, model, dopsf=True)
#
# The principal transitions between the data models are:
