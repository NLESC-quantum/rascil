SKA dish pointing error simulations
===================================

This calculates the change in a MID dirty image caused by wind-induced pointing errors:

    - The sky can be a point source at the half power point or a realistic sky constructed from S3-SEX catalog.
    - The observation is by MID over a range of hour angles
    - For each band, there are voltage pattern models at elevations 90, 45, and 15 degrees. These have been interpolated in elevation to a scale of 1 degree.
    - The visibility is calculated by Direct Fourier transform after having applied the antenna voltage beam for the given interpolated elevation.
    - Processing can be divided into chunks of time (default 1800s)
    - The noise level is measured by calculating the change in a small field dirty image induced by the pointing errors.
    - Dask is used to distribute the processing over a number of workers.
    - Various plots can be produced, The primary output is a csv file containing information about the statistics of the residual images.
