SKA dish pointing error simulations
===================================

This calculates the change in a dirty image caused by wind-induced pointing errors:

    - The sky can be a point source at the half power point or a realistic sky constructed from S3-SEX catalog.
    - The observation is by MID over a range of hour angles
    - Processing can be divided into chunks of time (default 1800s)
    - Dask is used to distribute the processing over a number of workers.
    - Various plots are produced, The primary output is a csv file containing information about the statistics of the residual images.
